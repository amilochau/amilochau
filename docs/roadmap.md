## Current quarter

### 2024 Q1

| State | Title | Tags | Comment |
| ----- | ----- | ---- | ------- |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Architect AWS with landing zones | `infra`, `devops` | We now have to support multiple organizations, with their own infrastructure. We should rework our AWS accounts to architect with landing zones. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Configure AWS SSO | `infra`, `security` | Using AWS root accounts is a bad practices, and not the easiest way to work with multiple AWS accounts. We should setup SSO with AWS, enforce it with least privilege, and make it work with our rewritten .NET AWS SDK. |
| üîú | Use GitHub repository templates | `devops` | We should define repository templates within GitHub, to help create repositories without Terraform files tracking. |

---

## Future quarters

These roadmap items are expected to be delivered soon. The dates indicated here are informative, and could change in the future.

### 2024 Q2+

| Title | Tags | Comment |
| ----- | ---- | ------- |
| Setup alerts on monitoring | `infra`, `monitoring` | Our resources are now monitored with different metrics and logs. We should configure alerts to be notified when thresholds on KPIs are met. |
| Use reusable GitHub workflows | `devops` | Instead of re-defining workflows in each repository, we should use reusable GitHub workflows, using our centralized GitHub Actions. |
| Migrate to .NET 9 | `csharp`, `core` | New versions for Microsoft-stack frameworks are regularly released. We should migrate our libraries and applications, and adapt our templates and workflows. |
| Use local databases | `infra`, `devops` | AWS serverless services are charged on consuption. To avoid overbilling during tests, we should use local databases. |

#### 2023 Q4

| State | Title | Tags | Comment |
| ----- | ----- | ---- | ------- |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Rewrite .NET AWS SDK | `csharp`, `core` | AWS SDK is not compatible with .NET Native AOT. We should rewrite it to make it compatible, and remove obsolete features to reduce its size. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Push notifications | `infra`, `web` | Push notifications can be used as a friendly way to communicate updates to users; we should use them, with a Lambda-based implementation using .NET Native AOT. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Migrate to .NET 8 | `csharp`, `core` | New versions for Microsoft-stack frameworks are regularly released. We should migrate our libraries and applications, and adapt our templates and workflows. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Landing pages | `web` | External users coming to our websites can't easily understand what they can do with them. We should add landing pages to explain the main available features. |
| Migrate to AWS Amplify SDK v6 | `web`, `core` | A new major version of AWS Amplify SDK, used for authentication with Cognito, can be used to improve performances. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Rewrite leaflet | `web`, `maps` | Leaflet is a great library for maps, but contains outdated code, without tree-shaking and many bugs. We should write a new maps library, inspired by leaflet. |

#### 2023 Q3

| State | Title | Tags | Comment |
| ----- | ----- | ---- | ------- |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Icons | `web` | Our websites lack a strong UI identity. Thanks to generative AI, we can now generate icons and images more easily. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | AWS budgets | `infra`, `monitoring` | With more services hosted in AWS, we should now manage budgets to avoid surprises with consumption-based resources. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Use AWS X-Ray | `infra`, `monitoring` | Multiple services hosted in AWS are hard to monitor, with their many dependencies. We should use AWS X-Ray. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Support PWA | `web` | Our applications should benefit from service worker capabilities; we should configure them as PWA. |

#### 2023 Q2

| State | Title | Tags | Comment |
| ----- | ----- | ---- | ------- |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Abandon SQL databases | `storage` | Azure SQL databases are expensive, and rarely match our needs - as we now use more hierarchical data. We should abandon SQL databases in our applications, and propose more efficient alternatives based on AWS services. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Migrate contacts to AWS | `infra`, `microservices` | The contacts microservice is hosted on Azure. Now we want to use AWS, we should migrate to a new Lambda-based application. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Migrate CV to AWS | `infra`, `microservices` | The CV page is hosted on Azure. Now we want to use AWS, we should migrate to a new S3-based application, using vue.js v3. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Abandon Azure | `infra`, `devops` | AWS is a proven way to make serverless applications better than Azure. We should migrate all our workloads. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Use Leaflet for maps | `web`, `maps` | Google Maps have poor performances and lacks important data. We should use leaflet, with OpenStreetMaps data. |

#### 2023 Q1

| State | Title | Tags | Comment |
| ----- | ----- | ---- | ------- |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Setup AWS Cognito | `infra`, `auth` | AWS Cognito can be used to authenticate our future Lambda-based services. We should setup it, and integrate it with our Front-End libraries. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Use native AOT for .NET | `infra`, `csharp` | New deployment models help to reduce cold start duration. We should build our Lambda-based applications as native AOT code, so we improve performances and decrease cost. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Use AWS for emails | `infra`, `microservices` | AWS proposes integrated workflows to send emails, with SES v2. We should define a Lambda-based process and migrate from Azure. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Use AWS for maps | `infra`, `microservices` | AWS proposes efficient serverless resources, with Lambda functions, API Gateway and CloudFront. We should rework the maps microservice as a Lambda-based application, and migrate from Azure. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Separate operations from *milochau.com* | `infra`, `microservices`, `business` | Operations are a specific business domain, today grouped in the *milochau.com* application. We should separate them, and deploy the new `operations` application as a serverless, Lambda-based application. |
